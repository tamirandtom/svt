        Name:"Aleph",
        Performer:"Ana Wild",
        Desc:'As an Israeli artist who lives and works in Europe, the engagement with questions concerning my identity is daily and poignant. Aleph is a solo piece created while I was living in Brussels and after completing my master’s degree in Amsterdam, in an attempt to broaden the language and terminology with which I explore questions of personal identity. To find not answers to these questions but rather a way to ask them. The Hebrew language is my mother-tongue thus it is carried with native ease by my voice and my body. It is a habitat in which I roam around. I look at the Hebrew landscape — which is a mother-tongue, and history. And tradition, and weather, and culture, and identity — and try to figure out my own identity, and its relation to time and space. Through the figure of an anonymous girl, I move away from the autobiographical and embark on a journey in my own language. As a trickster, I can challenge the emergence of language — Aleph — with its own “weapon”: language itself.',
